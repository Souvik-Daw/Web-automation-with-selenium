In the beginning my preparation was focused more on theoretical knowledge rather than practical problem-solving. ❌ Mistake 2️⃣:I focused too heavily on DSA, neglecting the importance of system design. Coming from a service-based background, my experience with designing large-scale systems was limited, and I didn’t spend enough time on it. ❌ Mistake 3️⃣:I didn't properly familiarize myself with the specific tech stack and tools used by the PBC I was applying to. While I had strong software development skills, but I lacked experience with specific frameworks, cloud services, and CI/CD pipelines.✅Remember, learning from mistakes is crucial, and overcoming these challenges will bring you one step closer to your dream job at your dream company Now, If you’re someone who needs help in improving the areas mentioned above and want a structured curriculum & Guidance I would suggest checking Bosscoder Academy Check here: https://bit.ly/3ya6ztT They provide a well-structured program that can help you master DSA, System Design, and Full Stack Development along with personal mentorship and 24/7 doubt supporthashtag#collab hashtag#mistakes hashtag#careerswitch\n",
